The order’s blessings became bargains. Those who sought help were promised deliverance—then lured into the old temple of the Silver Light, now a ruin.

With the tavern full, they are forced together at the bar itself, strangers sharing space. They soon hear rumors: families whispering about loved ones gone missing, blessings from the Silver Light turning hollow, and a beggar woman muttering of “light turned black.” This chapter bonds the party and sets the hook to investigate the Silver Light’s fall.",

Once bright with moonlit leaves and glimmering streams, it is now scarred—its wildlife restless, shadows moving where they shouldn’t. Here, the adventurers face skirmishes with corrupted acolytes and glimpse signs of a greater darkness. They may meet the beggar woman again, who hints at the truth: “Not all who bless serve the Keeper of Time.” The adventure continues on Aetheros, Day 2 (the day of Krylos).",
										"{@b Chapter 3 - The Ruin of Silver Light}: The adventurers reach the ruined temple of the Silver Light. Here they discover the cult’s High Priest and their terrible secret: supplicants lured to sacrifice, their lifeblood feeding the {@deity Xy'loth|demon lords|MTW}’s Pet. This becomes the adventure’s climactic battle. If victorious, the adventurers free the captives and break the cult’s hold—but their victory awakens something far worse. The battle could take place late on Aetheros, Day 2.",
										"{@b Epilogue - The Abyss Unveiled}: As the High Priest falls and the Pet is slain, the temple trembles. A rift tears open, and the {@deity Xy'loth|demon lords|MTW} manifests in his true abyssal form—Gargantuan, overwhelming, a being no mortal could stand against. Just as despair takes hold, the sky shatters into blinding light. Time cracks. Reality folds back."

Only the beggar woman’s gaze lingers, knowing the truth: history was rewritten by the Vaelithra."
