		"Unlike other demons who seek power or conquest, {@creature Xy'loth, the Archdemon|MTW|Xyloth}'s sole purpose is the ultimate unmaking of all things, returning them to the chaotic void from which it came. Its influence is insidious, working through whispers and subversion rather than brute force.",

They believe that by bringing about the \"{@adventure Ruin of Silver Light|MTW-VS|ruin-of-silver-light},\" they are paving the way for {@creature Xy'loth, the Archdemon|MTW|Xyloth}'s ultimate victory and the final liberation of all creation into pure chaos."
