		"{@deity Vaeil|The Primordials|MTW} is the benevolent deity who brought order from primordial chaos and established the flow of time. He is the guardian of the timeline, ensuring that the grand design of the cosmos unfolds as it should.",
		"While {@deity Vaeil|The Primordials|MTW} is often seen as a distant and impassive force, his influence is felt in the cycles of the seasons, the turning of the stars, and the natural progression of life and death. His followers, such as the {@creature Acolyte of Silver Light|VTRoSL1}, strive to maintain order, preserve knowledge, and protect the world from the disruptive influence of chaotic forces.",
		"{@deity Vaeil|The Primordials|MTW}'s power is not one of direct intervention, but of subtle guidance and correction. He acts through his devoted followers to restore balance and mend the tears in the fabric of reality caused by beings like {@creature Xy'loth, the Archdemon|MTW|Xyloth}. His greatest triumph was the ending of the {@adventure War of Sundering|MTW|war-of-sundering}, which he accomplished by resetting time, an act that fractured a part of his soul, creating the entity known as {@creature Vaelithra, Fragment of Vaeil|MTW|Vaelithra}."
