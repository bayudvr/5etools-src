In the city of Dewanginokori, they were beloved for their blessings—prayers over crops, safe births, successful trade, and guidance in life's trials.",
                "Recently, however, a group of Drow elves arrived claiming devotion to {@deity Vaeil|the primordials|MTW}. In truth, they were secret worshipers of {@deity Xy'loth|demon lords|MTW} and sacrifice. Slowly, they wormed their way into the Silver Light, twisting its rituals and climbing its ranks. By the dark month of Umbralos, when the shadows lengthen, one of them was raised to High Priest. The order's blessings became bargains. Those who sought help were promised deliverance—then lured into the old temple of the Silver Light, now a ruin. There, the faithful were sacrificed to feed a horrific abyssal creature, the Archdemon's Pet, {@creature The Abyssal Maw|MTW-VS}.",

When the adventurers arrive in Dewanginokori during a torrential storm, on Aetheros, Day 1, fate gathers them together at the Boar Smile Tavern—their meeting place and the start of their journey into the shadows of the Silver Light."
