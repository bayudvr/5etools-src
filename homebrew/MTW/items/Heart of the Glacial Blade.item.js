      "A jagged, crystalline shard that formed from the heart of Harann Nemmonis. It shines with a dim blue light and is unnaturally cold to the touch.",
      "This shard can be forged into a sword or an axe. When used as a weapon, it deals an additional 1d6 cold and 1d6 piercing damage. The wielder is also able to ignore the movement penalties from difficult terrain composed of ice or snow."
