		"A deep purple envelope with a silver wax seal engraved with an expressionless mask. It smells sweet like vanilla. When opened, the envelope transforms into a glowing lilac carnival ticket with a bubblegum scent and elastic texture.",
		"An invitation to enter the Violet Carnival. The ticket has a 'bite' system that functions as an access key to various attractions. Each player gets 5 bites at the start.",
		"This ticket is magical and cannot be forged. If lost, players must find another way to gain access to the carnival."
