				"For centuries, the Silver Light order served as acolytes of {@deity Vaeil|the primordials|MTW}, God of Time and Keeper of the Archive. In the city of Dewanginokori, they were beloved for their blessings\u2014prayers over crops, safe births, successful trade, and guidance in life's trials.",
				"Recently, however, a group of Drow elves arrived claiming devotion to {@deity Vaeil|the primordials|MTW}. In truth, they were secret worshipers of {@deity Xy'loth|demon lords|MTW} and sacrifice. Slowly, they wormed their way into the Silver Light, twisting its rituals and climbing its ranks. By the dark month of Umbralos, when the shadows lengthen, one of them was raised to High Priest. The order's blessings became bargains. Those who sought help were promised deliverance\u2014then lured into the old temple of the Silver Light, now a ruin. There, the faithful were sacrificed to feed a horrific abyssal creature, the Archdemon's Pet, {@creature The Abyssal Maw|MTW-VS}.",

This {@creature Vaelithra, Fragment of Vaeil|MTW|Vaelithra} cannot act directly but watches for mortals brave enough to intervene. When the adventurers arrive in Dewanginokori during a torrential storm, on Aetheros, Day 1, fate gathers them together at the Boar Smile Tavern\u2014their meeting place and the start of their journey into the shadows of the Silver Light."

						"{@b Chapter 1 - Boar Smile Tavern}: The adventurers arrive in Dewanginokori on the stormy evening of Aetheros, Day 1. With the tavern full, they are forced together at the bar itself, strangers sharing space. They soon hear rumors: families whispering about loved ones gone missing, blessings from the Silver Light turning hollow, and a beggar woman muttering of \"light turned black.\" This chapter bonds the party and sets the hook to investigate the Silver Light's fall.",
						"{@b Chapter 2 - The Silver Forest}: Following clues leads the adventurers into the Silver Forest, the sacred woods once tended by the Silver Light. Once bright with moonlit leaves and glimmering streams, it is now scarred\u2014its wildlife restless, shadows moving where they shouldn't. Here, the adventurers face skirmishes with corrupted acolytes and glimpse signs of a greater darkness. They may meet the beggar woman again, who hints at the truth: \"Not all who bless serve the Keeper of Time.\" The adventure continues on the same or next day",
						"{@b Chapter 3 - The Ruin of Silver Light}: The adventurers reach the ruined temple of the Silver Light. Here they discover the cult's High Priest and their terrible secret: supplicants lured to sacrifice, their lifeblood feeding the {@deity Xy'loth|demon lords|MTW}'s Pet. This becomes the adventure's climactic battle. If victorious, the adventurers free the captives and break the cult's hold\u2014but their victory awakens something far worse.",
						"{@b Epilogue - The Abyss Unveiled}: As the High Priest falls and {@creature The Abyssal Maw|MTW-VS} is slain, the temple trembles. A rift tears open, and the {@deity Xy'loth|demon lords|MTW} manifests in his true abyssal form\u2014Gargantuan, overwhelming, a being no mortal could stand against. Just as despair takes hold, the sky shatters into blinding light. Time cracks. Reality folds back."

				"The adventurers find themselves once more at the Boar Smile Tavern, the storm still raging outside, as if no time has passed. The date is Aetheros, Day 1 once again\u2014but now the Silver Light is whole again, their order loyal to {@deity Vaeil|the primordials|MTW} once more. Only the beggar woman's gaze lingers, knowing the truth: history was rewritten by the {@creature Vaelithra, Fragment of Vaeil|MTW|Vaelithra}."
