The magical, unnatural cold lifts, causing frozen waterfalls to cascade down the cliffs and thick layers of rime to fall from the rigging of the {@i Glowing Gate}. The sky is suddenly clear, and birds circle overhead, filling the air with sound and color long absent from Raijinsho. {@b Captain Thania Schmidt} keeps her word, nodding stiffly as her crew confirms the magical haul. They set sail immediately, singing shanties of victory and treasure."
