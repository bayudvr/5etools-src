				"This is the climax of the adventure, where the party faces the source of the city's corruption. This chapter is designed as a two-phase combat encounter, escalating from a standard battle against the cult leaders to a full-blown boss fight. The transition should be dramatic, triggered by the players' success in the first phase. The final intervention by the {@creature Vaelithra, Fragment of Vaeil|MTW|Vaelithra} serves as a narrative device to prevent a Total Party Kill, making the encounter cinematic and allowing the story to flow into the epilogue."

				"After navigating the corrupted forest, the adventurers arrive at what was once the grand entrance to the temple of the Silver Light. The gate stands as a grim silhouette against the stormy sky, its intricate carvings of Vaeil and his celestial Archives now defaced and covered in abyssal glyphs. The air here is cold and heavy with the scent of decay. A low, guttural chanting echoes from within the ruins, a foul perversion of the order's old prayers. The path leads to a shattered, overgrown stairway that descends into darkness."

				"As the adventurers descend into the main hall of the temple, the chanting stops. Five figures stand before a jagged rift in reality, their silver robes stained with blood and filth. In the center, the High Priest, a Drow Elf, turns to face them, his eyes glowing with black light. He is flanked by two robed Priests and three hooded Acolytes, who clutch their daggers with zealous fervor. The High Priest raises his hands, his voice echoing with a cruel mockery of Vaeil's blessing. \"You have intruded on the most sacred of rituals,\" he hisses. \"You are not a sacrifice... you are simply a feast!\"",

The abyssal chanting swells into a roar as the true lord of these ruins emerges: {@creature The Abyssal Maw|MTW-VS}. A gargantuan, multi-limbed creature of nightmare, it is a fleshy, chitinous horror with an impossibly wide maw filled with rows of razor-sharp teeth. Its body seems to warp and pull at the space around it, its movements erratic and alien. It has been a long time since its master fed it so well, and it is hungry for more."

This is the {@creature Vaelithra, Fragment of Vaeil|MTW|Vaelithra}'s power, a desperate act to correct a timeline that has gone too far. The light strikes the Maw, scorching it and instantly incinerating any remaining cultists. The Maw's body convulses, and it is left with only 20% of its total hit points remaining. The air shimmers with temporal energy, and for a fleeting moment, the adventurers catch a glimpse of the beggar woman from the tavern, her eyes glowing with impossible power, before the scene resets."
