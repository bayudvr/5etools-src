The Silver Forest is the players' first real taste of the corruption they are investigating, a place of twisted beauty that conceals a very real menace. This serves as a vital combat trial, meant to test your party's cohesion and combat strategy.",

				"As the adventurers step beneath the forest canopy, they are met by an eerie, sudden stillness. The air grows heavy, muffling their footsteps and the patter of the rain, as if they've walked into a vacuum. The ancient trees and stones here are scarred with deep, jagged gashes, as though claws or blades have carved at the land itself. Strange silver motes drift through the branches, shimmering faintly before dissolving into nothingness when touched. Every now and then, a faint whisper\u2014like a distorted prayer\u2014echoes through the silence, carried on a non-existent breeze.",
