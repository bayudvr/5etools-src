Seeking warmth and shelter, they enter the Boar Smile Tavern, a bustling establishment packed full of travelers, locals, and laborers all waiting out the weather. With no empty tables left, the characters are forced to sit side by side at the bar, strangers drawn together by chance\u2014or perhaps fate.",

				"A group of Silver Light acolytes sit near the bar, their silver-embroidered robes darkened with damp. Once revered as the city's blessing-givers, now they mutter among themselves, avoiding the gaze of common folk. A farmer leans in to whisper:",
				"\"They don't bless the crops anymore. Those who beg their help vanish into the forest... and never come back.\""

While they do, snippets of hushed conversation drift from the other customers. These whispers are the first hints that something is deeply wrong in the city."

With slightly disheveled blond hair and a pair of friendly green eyes, he greeted every newcomer with a warm smile. His build was unassuming, but his attire suggested a readiness for action: a white shirt and black vest paired with brown pants rolled up at the ankles. Your eye might be drawn to the sheathed shortsword on his back, a clear sign that he was more than just a man pouring drinks."

Her uniform consisted of a tough, sleeveless gambeson over a loose-fitting tunic, and practical boots. The centerpiece of her gear, however, was a large, two-handed hammer that leaned against the wall next to her. She didn't seem to be in a rush, a silent guardian of the peace, ready to spring into action if needed."
